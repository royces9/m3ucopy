# m3ucopy
copy files from an m3u file to a given directory

Usage:
compile with:

gcc main.c -o m3ucopy

Execute with:

./m3ucopy /m3u/source/directory.m3u /song/target/directory/

m3u files are not necessarily the only compatible file, as long as the file lists just the directories of the files to be copied, it should work.
